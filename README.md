# AIPhone

Call (844) 598-0141 to try it out!

AIPhone is an AI-based phone assistant that provides troubleshooting suggestions for various issues. The application is built using Flask, the Twilio API, and the OpenAI GPT-4 model. AIPhone is capable of understanding user speech input and providing appropriate responses to help them resolve their problems.

The application is available at (844) 598-0141. It's still under development, so if you encounter any issues, please report them here or through the contact section on the homepage.

### Core Functionality
AIPhone is designed to handle incoming phone calls, understand the user's speech input, and provide troubleshooting suggestions based on the user's questions. The application maintains a conversation history to provide context-aware responses, making it more effective in assisting users.

### Key Features

- Utilizing the GPT-4 model to provide intelligent and context-aware troubleshooting suggestions.
- Maintaining conversation history for a better understanding of user issues and providing relevant responses.
- Handling speech recognition and text-to-speech using the Twilio API.

### Future Plans
In future iterations of AIPhone, I plan to add the following features:

- Much more expressive voices using Elevenlabs text-to-speech API
- Fix delay after user talks
- Smarter AI model - currently on GPT-3.5-turbo for performance, using GPT-4 caused timeouts because it takes longer to process
- Web Portal
- Conversation history
- Integration with aiitsupport.net for business-specific troubleshooting and documentation
- Hand-off or automatic hangup when call is over


### Technologies & Tools
While building AIPhone, I worked with the following technologies and tools:

- Flask (Python web framework)
- Twilio API (Phone call handling, speech recognition, and text-to-speech)
- OpenAI GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 (AI language model)
- Heroku (Deployment platform)

I also used other tech before it was working on the phone:
- Elevenlabs API and custom voices (I cloned my own voice!)
- tkinter for GUI
- PyDub, PyAudio for dealing with audio files
- OpenAI Whisper API for transcription

### Learning Experience
Building AIPhone has been a valuable learning experience. I've never built something before that works over the phone! This project involved working with various technologies and tools, such as Flask, Twilio API, OpenAI GPT-4, and Heroku. The development process involved gaining a deeper understanding of speech recognition, text-to-speech, and AI language models. Additionally, it provided an opportunity to work with a deployment platform to make the application accessible to users.

The AIPhone project has been an exciting journey, and I'm glad that I can work with GPT technology in it's infancy while also having the skill to integrate it into something as unique as a phone call. It's a much different environment than web development but I like challenges. Thanks for reading!
