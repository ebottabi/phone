- 3 large eggs
Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 350°F. Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans.
2. In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.
3. Add butter, milk, and vanilla; beat with an electric mixer on low speed for 1 minute.
4. Add eggs; beat on low speed 2 minutes.
5. Pour batter evenly into pans.
6. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
7. Allow cakes to cool completely in pans, then remove from pans and frost as desired. Is there anything else you need help with?
